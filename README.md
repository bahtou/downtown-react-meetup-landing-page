### Fonts

### Layouts

Layouts are more of an art than a science. They are dependent on the content. Usually, the design team is working with a layout system which the developers implement with CSS. 

Once the layouts are fixed for the target sizes use CSS Grids & Flex-box to implement

#### for Web

For a screen size of 1440px, a layout of 6 columns with a gutter size of 24px gives a based unit of 98px. This can be harmonized with a 2-1-1-2-2-1-1-2 column metric.

#### for Mobile

For a screen size of 375px, a layout of 16 columns with a gutter size of 9px gives a based unit of 15px. This can be harmonized with a 1-1-3-1-2-2-1-3-1-1 column metric, a 10 column layout. A 1-1-2-4-4-2-1-1 harmonic can also be used, which results in a 8 column layout with the same base unit.
